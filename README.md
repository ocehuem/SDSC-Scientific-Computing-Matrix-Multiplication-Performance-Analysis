CS601: Scientific Computing & High-Performance Software Development

Developed high-performance matrix multiplication implementations with all loop orderings, BLAS library functions, and SSE/SSE3 intrinsics, analyzing performance and cache efficiency using Valgrind Cachegrind.

Designed modular grid-based software for solving 1D heat diffusion PDEs using RDomain, GridFn, and Solution classes, supporting time-stepping, boundary conditions, and binary file output.

Optimized array summation programs (sum11.c â†’ sum12.c) to achieve zero last-layer cache misses and debugged/corrected matrix diagonal summation programs using GDB and Valgrind, ensuring memory safety and correctness.

Implemented a generic C++17 container class supporting element indexing and custom concatenation with operator overloading and memory-safe practices, validated using assertions.

Tools & Frameworks: C, C++, Makefile, BLAS, SSE/SSE3 intrinsics, Valgrind, GDB, Doxygen, Bash, Git/GitHub.
Concepts: High-performance computing, cache optimization, memory-safe programming, numerical methods, debugging, automated documentation generation, object-oriented design, vectorization, loop unrolling, file I/O.
