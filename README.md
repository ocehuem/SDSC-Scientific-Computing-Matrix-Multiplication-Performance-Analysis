CS601: Scientific Computing â€“ High-Performance Matrix and Grid-Based Computations

Developed matrix multiplication implementations with all loop orderings, BLAS library functions, and SSE/SSE3 intrinsics, analyzing performance with Valgrind Cachegrind for cache efficiency.

Designed modular grid-based software for solving 1D heat diffusion PDEs using RDomain, GridFn, and Solution classes, supporting time-stepping, boundary conditions, and binary file output.

Applied object-oriented design, file I/O, loop unrolling, vectorization, and numerical methods for high-performance computation.

Tools & Frameworks: C++, Makefile, BLAS, SSE/SSE3 intrinsics, Valgrind, Doxygen, Bash, Git/GitHub.
