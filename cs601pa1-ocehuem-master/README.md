# CS601 PA1: Scientific Computing â€“ Matrix Multiplication and Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This assignment focuses on hands-on experience with **high-performance computing techniques**, including Makefile usage, library functions, compiler intrinsics, and memory profiling. The objective is to implement, optimize, and analyze matrix and matrix-vector operations for efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Components

### 1. Matrix Multiplication (`matmul.cpp`)
- Implemented all possible **loop orderings** (ijk, ikj, jik, jki, kij, kji) for square matrices.  
- Supports **single-precision (`-DSINGLE`) and double-precision (`-DDOUBLE`)** data.  
- Integrated with **Makefile commands** for build and run (`make build_matmul_single`, `make run_matmul_single`, etc.).  
- Collected execution times and **last-layer cache read misses** using Valgrind Cachegrind.

### 2. BLAS-based Matrix Operations
- Implemented **matrix multiplication** using **BLAS dot-product** and **sgemm** functions.  
- Tabulated execution times and cache metrics for single-precision matrices.

### 3. Matrix-Vector Multiplication (`matvec.cpp`)
- Used **Intel SSE3 intrinsics** (_mm_load_ps, _mm_store_ps, etc.) for vectorized matrix-vector products.  
- Implemented **loop unrolling** for inner loops to leverage SIMD parallelism.  
- Performance analysis conducted with **Valgrind Cachegrind**.

## ðŸ“Œ Tools & Frameworks
- **Programming:** C++  
- **Build & Automation:** Make, Makefile, Conditional Compilation
