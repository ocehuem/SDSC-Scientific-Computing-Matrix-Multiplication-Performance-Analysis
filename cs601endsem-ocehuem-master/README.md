CS601 End-Semester Assignment â€“ Custom C++ Container
Implemented a generic container class supporting element indexing and custom concatenation operations, validated with assertions. Applied operator overloading, memory-safe programming, and structured C++17 template usage.

# CS601 End-Semester Assignment: Custom Container Operations

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This assignment focuses on **custom container implementation, operator overloading, and memory-safe programming in C++**. It consists of multiple operations on a template container class `MyContainer<T>`:

1. Extend `MyContainer` to support **element assignment and indexing**.  
2. Implement **custom addition operator** to concatenate a string to elements.  
3. Ensure correctness using **assertions** and track lines of code added.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Components

### Question 1 â€“ Element Assignment (`mycontainer.h`)
- Modified the template class `MyContainer` to support **assignment and indexing**.  
- Allowed storing and accessing elements using `[]` operator.

### Question 2 â€“ Custom Operations (`mycontainer.cpp`)
- Added support for **element concatenation via operator `+`**.  
- Ensured correct update of existing elements without memory leaks.  
- Verified behavior with **assertions** in `main.cpp`.

### Question 3 â€“ Declaration & Academic Honesty
- Tracked **lines of code added** using `numLinesOfCodeAdded`.  
- Output includes contributor declaration for transparency.

### Execution
Build and run the program using the following commands:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp mycontainer.cpp -o endsem_part2
./endsem_part2
```
ðŸ“Œ Deliverables

mycontainer.h â€“ Modified template class header.

mycontainer.cpp â€“ Implementation of required operations.

main.cpp â€“ Test driver (DO NOT MODIFY).

Output showing lines of code added and assertion validation.

ðŸ“Œ Tools & Frameworks

Programming: C++17

Build & Automation: g++ compiler

Debugging & Verification: Assertions, memory-safe programming

Version Control: Git, GitHub

ðŸ“Œ Concepts

Template classes in C++

Operator overloading ([], +)

Memory management and safe programming practices

Automated testing with assertions

- This repository contains 4 files: `main.cpp`, `mycontainer.cpp`, `mycontainer.h`, and `makefile`.
- You must not modify `main.cpp`. Doing so will fetch you a zero in this assignment.
- You must not add any additional file(s) to this repository. Doing so will fetch you a zero in this assignment.
- Open `main.cpp` to see the questions and answer accordingly.

Submission Instructions
*The submission instructions for turning in this exam is similar to what you have been following for homework/programming assignments.*
