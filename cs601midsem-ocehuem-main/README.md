1. (3 points) You need to use `sum11.c` for this question. `sum11.c` contains a program that allocates an array of `U` = 10 million elements, and then sums `N` = 75 million elements chosen at random. Run this program in your local environment (*not the hip server*). *hip server executions will not be accpted.*
	1. Execute this program (without any command line arguments) and measure/report (write down) the last-layer and first-layer cache data misses. Include a screenshot that shows the numbers.
	2. Your goal is to reduce the last-layer miss rate to 0 as reported by valgrind. To achieve this goal, first you inspect the sizes of cache hierarchy in your local environment and then modify the value of either `N` or `U` in the program. Make a copy of `sum11.c` and name the file as `sum12.c`. Make all the modifications in `sum12.c`. Report (write down) the last-layer and first-layer cache data misses. Also, write down the sizes of cache memory in each layer that exists in your local environment. Write down the command that you used to report these numbers for cache memory sizes. Include a screenshot that shows the cache miss results.

2. `sumdiagonal.cpp` implements incorrectly a program to compute the sum of diagonal elements of a square matrix. You may assume that the inputs provided are correct and not too large. Resolve all errors that include compiler, linker, and memory errors. In addition, resolve all other kinds of errors (e.g. correctness) you come accross. You may need to use GDB to debug some of the errros. Make sure that you use Valgrind to detect and fix all memory errors. When you are done resolving all the errors and have a functioanlly correct working program, insert comments to the program so that Doxygen generates a documentation corresponding to the source code. You must use the `@brief`, `@bug`, `@author`, `@file`, `@fn`, and `@param` directives in your comments. `@bug` must list all the bugs that you have fixed to make the implementation error free.

**deliverables**: 
- `Makefile1` containing targets q11 and q12. each target should compile `sum11.c` or `sum12.c` as appropriate and execute under valgrind reporting the details as explained in 1.1 and 1.2 above. 
- `1.pdf` containing the writeup and screenshots as mentioned above. 
- `sum12.c`.
- `Makefile2` and all the source code (modified sumdiagonal.cpp and the documentation related files) that you have for Question 2. You need to include a target called `sumdiagonal` in `Makefile2` that builds and executes your code containing modified implementation. Upon executing the command `make -f Makefile2 DOCS=1" you should produce doxygen assisted documentation as described in Question 2.

When you are done answering the questions you must tag the repository as `cs601midsemsubmission`
